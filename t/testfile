You might need a test file to read from in your test suite. A natural place to put that is in t/testfile alongside your tests -- but Test::MinimumVersion will choke on that file: [@Author::DOHERTY/MinimumPerl] Unable to parse 't/testfile' at /home/mike/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.14.0- RC1/lib/site_perl/5.14.0/x86_64-linux/Moose/Meta/Method/Delegation.pm line 110 You should either skip files that can't be parsed, or look only at *.t files. Probably the latter, since even test scripts can have errors :)
